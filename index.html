<img src="leah.jpg" width=150 border="0" align="right" style="padding:7px;"><span style="line-height:16px">I have recently started working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. My main research focus is the subject of galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution, from an observational perspective using multiwavelength data. Prior to this, I earned my PhD at the University of Leiden, working under Huub R&ouml;ttgering. My thesis work was focused on studying radio galaxies at low frequencies using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), using both spectroscopy and high resolution imaging. These techniques are challenging to implement at low radio frequencies, where distortions due to ionospheric interference are particularly strong. My thesis features the first extragalactic detection of low-frequency carbon radio recombination lines. Detected in M82, these lines trace the cold, diffuse gas that seems to be associated with the central region of this nuclear starburst galaxy. I was also able to produce the highest resolution image at frequencies less than 100 MHz, using the full international LOFAR array. This image of a distant radio galaxy showed that it looks much like the radio galaxies we see in the local Universe. 
<!--In particular, we hope to be able to explain why there is a correlation between radio spectral index steepness and redshift. The international stations of LOFAR offer baselines long enough to make spatially resolved images of them the galaxies at < 80 MHz in oder to probe the particle acceleration procsses present in these energetic sources (collaborators: Adam Deller, George Miley). Additionally, I am searching for low frequency carbon radio recombination lines (collaborators: Raymond Oonk, Francisco Salgado, Carmen Toribio, and Xander Tielens) in these objects. -->

Prior to my PhD, I earned my MSc in Physics at the University of Oklahoma under the supervision of Xinyu Dai. My MSc thesis focused on AGN feedback, and includes anaysis of X-ray observations of broad absorption line quasars (including three rare ones that exhibit Iron broad absorption lines). I also coded simulations to examine the M-sigma relation and determine that the observed relation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion is not caused by selection effects, although the slope of the relation can become shallower if selection effects are not accounted for.

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, earning a double major in Physics and Astronomy. I had a full scholarship from the US Air Force for my studies, and upon graduation in 2005, I served a six year committment as an officer, in the career field of Air Battle Management. This took me to Oklahoma, and I spent my final two years in the Air Force also working on my master's degree part-time.  
<br/>
<br/>
I am originally from Michigan, but have lived in six different regions of the USA, before moving to the Netherlands and then to Oxford. I enjoy reading, cooking, and outdoor activities.
