<img src="leah.jpg" width=150 border="0" align="right" style="padding:7px;"><span style="line-height:16px">I have just started my final year as a PhD student at the University of Leiden, working under Huub R&ouml;ttgering. My research is focused on studying high redshift radio galaxies at low frequencies using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). The combination of low frequency and high spatial resolution will help answer open questions high redshift radio galaxies. In particular, we hope to be able to explain why there is a correlation between radio spectral index steepness and redshift. The international stations of LOFAR offer baselines long enough to make spatially resolved images of them the galaxies at < 80 MHz in oder to probe the particle acceleration procsses present in these energetic sources (collaborators: Adam Deller, George Miley). Additionally, I am searching for low frequency carbon radio recombination lines (collaborators: Raymond Oonk, Francisco Salgado, Carmen Toribio, and Xander Tielens) in these objects.

<br/>
 I moved to the Netherlands in August 2012, from the US. I am originally from Michigan, but have lived in six different regions of the country. 
My undergraduate studies were conducted at the University of Michigan, and I then served a six year commitment to the US Air Force. 
That commitment took me to Oklahoma, where I completed my M.S. degree under the direction of Xinyu Dai. My M.S. thesis focused on AGN feedback, and includes anaysis of X-ray observations of broad absorption line quasars (including three rare ones that exhibit Iron broad absorption lines). I also coded simulations to examine the M-sigma relation and determine that the observed relation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion is not caused by selection effects, although the slope of the relation can become shallower if selection effects are not accounted for. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since finishing my M.S. degree, I have made the shift to the other end of the spectrum, and am now working on radio astronomy. 
In between the M.S. and PhD programs, I spent three months as a summer student at the NRAO in New Mexico, working with J&uuml;rgen Ott, Emmanuel Momjian, and Dave Meier, looking for ammonia lines in a nearby galaxy. Shifting even further into the radio regime, I now work on data from LOFAR and JVLA P-band.
