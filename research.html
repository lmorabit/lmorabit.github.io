	<b> High Redshift Radio Galaxies</b>
	<br/>
	<i>Collaborators: Adam Deller, Raymond Oonk, George Miley, Huub R&ouml;ttgering</i>
	<br/>
	I am working on low-frequency (30-60 MHz) long baseline observations of high redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs). These objects have never been spatially resolved at such low frequencies, and we hope to be able to create spectral index maps to study the internal spectral variation of the HzRGs.

	<b>Radio Recombination Lines </b>
	<br/>
	<i>Collaborators: Francisco Salgado, Raymond Oonk, Huub R&ouml;ttgering, Xander Tielens</i>
	<br/>
	Low-frequency radio recombination lines probe transitions between high quantum-number levels in atoms. Carbon radio recombination lines have been observed in our own Galaxy, and provide a method to constrain the properties of the cold, neutral medium. I am working on theoretical models to predict expected radio recombination line intensities for extragalactic sources.

	<b>LOFAR Commissioning</b>

	I help with LOFAR Commissioning projects, from investigating the stability and and sensitivity of the instrument for low-frequency spectroscopy to helping test new software.

	<b>AGN Feedback</b>
	<br/>
	My MSc thesis focused on two main themes:
	<br/>
	<b>1. </b>&nbsp;<i>AGN feedback is real, and we are likely underestimating the slope of the M-sigma relation.</i> <br/> I performed a Bayesian analysis of the M-sigma relation, and showed that it is unlikely to have occured by chance. 
		Additionally, I examined how the small, irregular sample size causes studies of the M-sigma relation to find a shallower slope of the M-sigma relation than the intrinsic slope. 
		This places constraints on which theories are viable, since the measurable prediction from theory is the slope. Our results favour a kinetic feedback scenario rather than radiative.
	<br/>
	<b>2. </b>&nbsp;<i>Broad Absorption Line Quasars are promising candidates for AGN feedback studies.</i> <br/> Using X-ray observations of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs), I find absorbing column densities that can be Compton-thick. There are several implications to this. The first is that X-ray and UV winds in BALQSOs are not co-located, or else we would see absorption in the UV as well, since Compton-scattering is frequency independent. The second is that we find BALQSOs are intrinsically X-ray weak, after correcting for the column density. Finally, we calculated feedback efficiencies of a few per cent from the absorbing column densities. With all the assumptions that go into the effficiency calculation, it is likely that these column densities are high enough to satisfy AGN feedback theories.
